# Tailwind CSS Gradient Distortion on Large Screens

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Tailwind CSS gradient background behaves unexpectedly on larger screens. The gradient appears distorted or doesn't apply correctly above a certain viewport width.

## Bug Description

When using a linear gradient background with `bg-gradient-to-r` and specific color classes, the gradient may distort or not render properly once the screen width exceeds a certain threshold. This behavior is inconsistent and may depend on the browser.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Resize the browser window. Observe the gradient's behavior as the width changes.

## Solution

The issue is likely due to the way Tailwind processes gradient background in combination with other styles or responsive design settings. There are a few solutions to try: 
* More specific class names to target gradient properties, preventing potential conflicts with other styles.
* Using different gradient directions or adjusting the color stop positions.
* Ensuring there are no conflicting styles that could affect the gradient's appearance.
* Updating or clearing browser cache and restarting browser.
